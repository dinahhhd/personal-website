  <p> I finished my high school after i took my SPM paper that ends around March 2023. I took 9 subjects in SPM paper including Malay, English, Sejarah, Mathematics, Science, Allughatul Arabiah, Usuluddin, Syariah, and Perniagaan. I didn't take PT3 paper because my batch is the first batch that PT3 has been abolished. Actually, when I was in Form 3, I was excited to study for PT3, but unfortunately we weren't able to take the PT3 exam that year. When I was in Form 4, my batch took the Religious Sijil Menengah Agama (SMA) exam which is mandatory for Form 4 students in several religious schools. The subjects consisted of Allughatul Arabiah, Usuluddin, Syariah, memorization of Quranic verses, Allughatul Arabiah language test and also memorization of Hadith. </p>

  <p>  Currently I am continuing my studies in the Diploma in Library Informatics at UiTM Kedah and now I am in the fourth semester. I started my studies here in September 2023. So I have studied here for a year and a half. I have faced various things from happy, sad, stressful and various study pressures I have faced. For me, I am very happy to be able to study this course because from an ordinary book I can learn various new things about books. It's not just a book, now I know how the books are managed in the library and how the information in the books is stored. </p>
  <p> Apart from subjects related to library materials, I have also studied various other subjects such as technology in libraries, information skills and management, data management, communication skills, metadata development, web content development, programming and also multimedia and digital publishing. I also has learned the cataloging for library materials using cataloging standard such as AACR2R, MARC and RDA. While this semester i learn LCSH, SLSH, LCC and DDC. Previous semester i also has learned the department in the library such as acquistion, circulation, reference services, and many more.</p>
