    <p> I am a shy and introvert girl but very cheerful, funny and talk a lot only with people I am close to. I can be sweet, laugh a lot when I am started to feel comfortable with someone. Actually I'm easily amused with just a random things if i found it funny. Because i am an introvert, i prefer to spending time alone but sometimes i will feel lonely. Yeah it is totally normal. I prefer to be alone because i don't need to overthinking that i hurt other people's feeling if i spend times more with other people.</p>
    <p> I live at Selangor and my family consist of 6 people. My mom, dad, two older brother and one younger brother. Yeah, i am the only daughter and the third child. I love my family so much and really love to spending time together with them. My first brother still continuing his study, my second brother already has a job near my home. My younger brother is currently in form 1 of high school. My mother is a housewife, she retired from her work after she gave birth to my younger brother. My father is still works to support our family.</p>
    <p> I am a cat lover and I have two cats at home. The first cat I gave its name "Utih" because its breed is lynx siamese cat that has white coat. Utih is a male cat and i have raised him since 2022 after my previous cat has gone. I loved my previous cat very much because it was by my side from the time I was 2 until I was 17. Losing her is the most heartbreaking moment of my life. Last month, my brother brought home an orange kitten and started to raised it until now.</p>

    <p> They are my high school friends, most of whom have been my friends since I was 13 years old. We have known each other since Form 1. We have had many ups and downs throughout our 5 years of school and living in the dormitory. However, not all of them were in the same class and dormitory as me during school. However, we always spent time together outside of school hours such as going to the dining hall together,  evening prep after Zuhur prayer and night prep after Maghrib prayer, revising together, spending time at musolla and so on.</p>
    <p> Everyone now have continued their studies and are following their own academic paths, and we rarely spend time together now since we are preoccupied with our individual lives. But we still keep in touch with each other, spend time together whenever we can, and provide support for each other even from a distance. </p>

    <p> One of my favourite moment in my life is working as a service crew at <span style="color: red;">Secret Recipe. </span> I really love working there because i love my work environment. I think I'm lucky to have a good coworkers that always encourage and support me. What I really like about working here is that I don't have any work pressure, the working hours are quite convenient, meals for staff are provided, there are no bad colleagues, and I have the opportunity to engage in various tasks besides being a waiter. </p>
	<p> One of my favorite tasks is cutting cakes. Perhaps it’s because I enjoy eating them, which makes me really enjoy serving them to customers. I also have the chance to learn how to prepare some simple drinks and cook my own meals. 
	 Eventhough there are times when we have a large number of customers and things get really busy, I am still happy with my job. Overall, I am very happy because my time at Secret Recipe marks my first job experience in my life &#x1F496;.
